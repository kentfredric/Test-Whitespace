                    [ qr/\x504/, '\x504 {{err}}' ],
                    [ qr/){/, 'Untidyness {{err}}' ],

PRIMARY AUDIENCE
    This Module is intended for Author Testing and Release testing.

RATIONALE / PRIMARY AUDIENCE
    There are many cases where Perl::Critic is useless to you:

    *   You have Non-Perl files that may be shipping with your dist

        For example, ".js" files, ".yaml" files, ".json" files, ".html"
        files.

    *   You don't care for any other critic policies.

        You just want to keep whitespace consistent and repressed.

    *   You have your own weird regex you want to mandate.

        And you never want to see that a string in your dist matches that
        regex, and you really cant be arsed writing a full blown critic
        policy and uploading it on CPAN for this one tiny case.

    In all of the above cases, this module is for you.
